- nlopt basic environment setup
  * create folder structure (bin[for dynamic library and .exe], include[for header files], sample[for source codes])
  * download nlopt (nonlinear optimization) from homebrew
  * find the nlopt header file from address "/opt/homebrew/include"
  * create a soft symbolic link of the nlopt header file "ln -s /opt/homebrew/include/nlopt.h nlopt.h" in the "include" folder
  * find the nlopt dynamic library file from address "opt/homebrew/lib"
  * create a soft symbolic link of the library file "ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib/libnlopt.dylib libnlopt.dylib" in the "bin" folder
  * testing with the "tutorial.c" (ps: need to custom your makefile to test this)
  * if test result get "found minimum at f(0.333333,0.296296) = 0.5443310474" then good to go

- optimization problem statement
